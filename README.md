**Problem 1: Least Recently Used Cache**

We have briefly discussed caching as part of a practice problem while studying hash maps.

The lookup operation (i.e., get()) and put() / set() is supposed to be fast for a cache memory.

While doing the get() operation, if the entry is found in the cache, it is known as a cache hit. If, however, the entry is not found, it is known as a cache miss.

When designing a cache, we also place an upper bound on the size of the cache. If the cache is full and we want to add a new entry to the cache, we use some criteria to remove an element. After removing an element, we use the put() operation to insert the new element. The remove operation should also be fast.

For our first problem, the goal will be to design a data structure known as a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. An LRU cache is a type of cache in which we remove the least recently used entry when the cache memory reaches its limit. For the current problem, consider both get and set operations as an use operation.

Your job is to use an appropriate data structure(s) to implement the cache.

In case of a cache hit, your get() operation should return the appropriate value.
In case of a cache miss, your get() should return -1.
While putting an element in the cache, your put() / set() operation must insert the element. If the cache is full, you must write code that removes the least recently used entry first and then insert the element.
All operations must take O(1) time.

For the current problem, you can consider the size of cache = 5.

**Problem 2: File Recursion**

For this problem, the goal is to write code for finding all files under a directory (and all directories beneath it) that end with ".c"

Note: os.walk() is a handy Python method which can achieve this task very easily. However, for this problem you are not allowed to use os.walk().

**Problem 3: Data Compression**

Overview:

In general, a data compression algorithm reduces the amount of memory (bits) required to represent a message (data). The compressed data, in turn, helps to reduce the transmission time from a sender to receiver. The sender encodes the data, and the receiver decodes the encoded data. As part of this problem, you have to implement the logic for both encoding and decoding.

A data compression algorithm could be either lossy or lossless, meaning that when compressing the data, there is a loss (lossy) or no loss (lossless) of information. The Huffman Coding is a lossless data compression algorithm with two phases -- encoding and decoding.

You will have to implement the logic for both Huffman encoding and decoding. 

**Problem 4: Active Directory**

In Windows Active Directory, a group can consist of user(s) and group(s) themselves. We can construct this hierarchy as such. Where User is represented by str representing their ids.

class Group(object):
    def __init__(self, _name):
        self.name = _name
        self.groups = []
        self.users = []

    def add_group(self, group):
        self.groups.append(group)

    def add_user(self, user):
        self.users.append(user)

    def get_groups(self):
        return self.groups

    def get_users(self):
        return self.users

    def get_name(self):
        return self.name


parent = Group("parent")
child = Group("child")
sub_child = Group("subchild")

sub_child_user = "sub_child_user"
sub_child.add_user(sub_child_user)

child.add_group(sub_child)
parent.add_group(child)

Write a function that provides an efficient look up of whether the user is in a group.

**Problem 5: Blockchain**

A Blockchain is a sequential chain of records, similar to a linked list. Each block contains some information and how it is connected related to the other blocks in the chain. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. For our blockchain we will be using a SHA-256 hash, the Greenwich Mean Time when the block was created, and text strings as the data.

Use your knowledge of linked lists and hashing to create a blockchain implementation.

**Problem 6: Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists**

Your task for this problem is to fill out the union and intersection functions. The union of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B. The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A ∩ B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B.

You will take in two linked lists and return a linked list that is composed of either the union or intersection, respectively. Once you have completed the problem you will create your own test cases and perform your own run time analysis on the code.
